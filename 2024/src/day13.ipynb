    "<article class=\"day-desc\"><h2>--- Day 13: Claw Contraption ---</h2><p>Next up: the <a href=\"/2020/day/24\">lobby</a> of a resort on a tropical island. The Historians take a moment to admire the hexagonal floor tiles before spreading out.</p>\n",
    "<p>Fortunately, it looks like the resort has a new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_arcade\">arcade</a>! Maybe you can win some prizes from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_machine\" target=\"_blank\">claw machines</a>?</p>\n",
    "<p>The claw machines here are a little unusual. Instead of a joystick or directional buttons to control the claw, these machines have two buttons labeled <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Worse, you can't just put in a token and play; it costs <em>3 tokens</em> to push the <code>A</code> button and <em>1 token</em> to push the <code>B</code> button.</p>\n",
    "<p>With a little experimentation, you figure out that each machine's buttons are configured to move the claw a specific amount to the <em>right</em> (along the <code>X</code> axis) and a specific amount <em>forward</em> (along the <code>Y</code> axis) each time that button is pressed.</p>\n",
    "<p>Each machine contains one <em>prize</em>; to win the prize, the claw must be positioned <em>exactly</em> above the prize on both the <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> axes.</p>\n",
    "<p>You wonder: what is the smallest number of tokens you would have to spend to win as many prizes as possible? You assemble a list of every machine's button behavior and prize location (your puzzle input). For example:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>Button A: X+94, Y+34\n",
    "Button B: X+22, Y+67\n",
    "Prize: X=8400, Y=5400<br/>\n",
    "Button A: X+26, Y+66\n",
    "Button B: X+67, Y+21\n",
    "Prize: X=12748, Y=12176<br/>\n",
    "Button A: X+17, Y+86\n",
    "Button B: X+84, Y+37\n",
    "Prize: X=7870, Y=6450<br/>\n",
    "Button A: X+69, Y+23\n",
    "Button B: X+27, Y+71\n",
    "Prize: X=18641, Y=10279\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This list describes the button configuration and prize location of four different claw machines.</p>\n",
    "<p>For now, consider just the first claw machine in the list:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Pushing the machine's <code>A</code> button would move the claw <code>94</code> units along the <code>X</code> axis and <code>34</code> units along the <code>Y</code> axis.</li>\n",
    "<li>Pushing the <code>B</code> button would move the claw <code>22</code> units along the <code>X</code> axis and <code>67</code> units along the <code>Y</code> axis.</li>\n",
    "<li>The prize is located at <code>X=8400</code>, <code>Y=5400</code>; this means that from the claw's initial position, it would need to move exactly <code>8400</code> units along the <code>X</code> axis and exactly <code>5400</code> units along the <code>Y</code> axis to be perfectly aligned with the prize in this machine.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>The cheapest way to win the prize is by pushing the <code>A</code> button <code>80</code> times and the <code>B</code> button <code>40</code> times. This would line up the claw along the <code>X</code> axis (because <code>80*94 + 40*22 = 8400</code>) and along the <code>Y</code> axis (because <code>80*34 + 40*67 = 5400</code>). Doing this would cost <code>80*3</code> tokens for the <span title=\"Half A presses are not allowed.\"><code>A</code> presses</span> and <code>40*1</code> for the <code>B</code> presses, a total of <code><em>280</em></code> tokens.</p>\n",
    "<p>For the second and fourth claw machines, there is no combination of A and B presses that will ever win a prize.</p>\n",
    "<p>For the third claw machine, the cheapest way to win the prize is by pushing the <code>A</code> button <code>38</code> times and the <code>B</code> button <code>86</code> times. Doing this would cost a total of <code><em>200</em></code> tokens.</p>\n",
    "<p>So, the most prizes you could possibly win is two; the minimum tokens you would have to spend to win all (two) prizes is <code><em>480</em></code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>You estimate that each button would need to be pressed <em>no more than <code>100</code> times</em> to win a prize. How else would someone be expected to play?</p>\n",
    "<p>Figure out how to win as many prizes as possible. <em>What is the fewest tokens you would have to spend to win all possible prizes?</em></p>\n",
