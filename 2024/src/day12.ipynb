There's plenty of food, so The Historians grab something to eat while they search.</p>\n",
    "<p>You're about to settle near a complex arrangement of garden plots when some Elves ask if you can lend a hand. They'd like to set up <span title=\"I originally wanted to title this puzzle &quot;Fencepost Problem&quot;, but I was afraid someone would then try to count fenceposts by mistake and experience a fencepost problem.\">fences</span> around each region of garden plots, but they can't figure out how much fence they need to order or how much it will cost. They hand you a map (your puzzle input) of the garden plots.</p>\n",
    "<p>Each garden plot grows only a single type of plant and is indicated by a single letter on your map. When multiple garden plots are growing the same type of plant and are touching (horizontally or vertically), they form a <em>region</em>. For example:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>AAAA\n",
    "BBCD\n",
    "BBCC\n",
    "EEEC\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>This 4x4 arrangement includes garden plots growing five different types of plants (labeled <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, and <code>E</code>), each grouped into their own region.</p>\n",
    "<p>In order to accurately calculate the cost of the fence around a single region, you need to know that region's <em>area</em> and <em>perimeter</em>.</p>\n",
    "<p>The <em>area</em> of a region is simply the number of garden plots the region contains. The above map's type <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code> plants are each in a region of area <code>4</code>. The type <code>E</code> plants are in a region of area <code>3</code>; the type <code>D</code> plants are in a region of area <code>1</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Each garden plot is a square and so has <em>four sides</em>. The <em>perimeter</em> of a region is the number of sides of garden plots in the region that do not touch another garden plot in the same region. The type <code>A</code> and <code>C</code> plants are each in a region with perimeter <code>10</code>. The type <code>B</code> and <code>E</code> plants are each in a region with perimeter <code>8</code>. The lone <code>D</code> plot forms its own region with perimeter <code>4</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Visually indicating the sides of plots in each region that contribute to the perimeter using <code>-</code> and <code>|</code>, the above map's regions' perimeters are measured as follows:</p>\n",

    "OXOXO\n",
    "OOOOO\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>The above map contains <em>five</em> regions, one containing all of the <code>O</code> garden plots, and the other four each containing a single <code>X</code> plot.</p>\n",
    "<p>The four <code>X</code> regions each have area <code>1</code> and perimeter <code>4</code>. The region containing <code>21</code> type <code>O</code> plants is more complicated; in addition to its outer edge contributing a perimeter of <code>20</code>, its boundary with each <code>X</code> region contributes an additional <code>4</code> to its perimeter, for a total perimeter of <code>36</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Due to \"modern\" business practices, the <em>price</em> of fence required for a region is found by <em>multiplying</em> that region's area by its perimeter. The <em>total price</em> of fencing all regions on a map is found by adding together the price of fence for every region on the map.</p>\n",
    "<p>In the first example, region <code>A</code> has price <code>4 * 10 = 40</code>, region <code>B</code> has price <code>4 * 8 = 32</code>, region <code>C</code> has price <code>4 * 10 = 40</code>, region <code>D</code> has price <code>1 * 4 = 4</code>, and region <code>E</code> has price <code>3 * 8 = 24</code>. So, the total price for the first example is <code><em>140</em></code>.</p>\n",
