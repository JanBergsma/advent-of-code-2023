    "<p>Fuel itself requires fuel just like a module - take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.  However, that fuel <em>also</em> requires fuel, and <em>that</em> fuel requires fuel, and so on.  Any mass that would require <em>negative fuel</em> should instead be treated as if it requires <em>zero fuel</em>; the remaining mass, if any, is instead handled by <em>wishing really hard</em>, which has no mass and is outside the scope of this calculation.</p>\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>A module of mass <code>14</code> requires <code>2</code> fuel.  This fuel requires no further fuel (2 divided by 3 and rounded down is <code>0</code>, which would call for a negative fuel), so the total fuel required is still just <code>2</code>.</li>\n",

So, the total fuel required for a module of mass <code>1969</code> is <code>654 + 216 + 70 + 21 + 5 = 966</code>.</li>\n",
