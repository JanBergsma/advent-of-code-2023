    "<p>The cups will be arranged in a circle and labeled <em>clockwise</em> (your puzzle input). For example, if your labeling were <code>32415</code>, there would be five cups in the circle; going clockwise around the circle from the first cup, the cups would be labeled <code>3</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>5</code>, and then back to <code>3</code> again.</p>\n",
    "<p>Before the crab starts, it will designate the first cup in your list as the <em>current cup</em>. The crab is then going to do <em>100 moves</em>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Each <em>move</em>, the crab does the following actions:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>The crab picks up the <em>three cups</em> that are immediately <em>clockwise</em> of the <em>current cup</em>. They are removed from the circle; cup spacing is adjusted as necessary to maintain the circle.</li>\n",
    "<li>The crab selects a <em>destination cup</em>: the cup with a <em>label</em> equal to the <em>current cup's</em> label minus one. If this would select one of the cups that was just picked up, the crab will keep subtracting one until it finds a cup that wasn't just picked up. If at any point in this process the value goes below the lowest value on any cup's label, it <em>wraps around</em> to the highest value on any cup's label instead.</li>\n",
    "<li>The crab places the cups it just picked up so that they are <em>immediately clockwise</em> of the destination cup. They keep the same order as when they were picked up.</li>\n",
    "<li>The crab selects a new <em>current cup</em>: the cup which is immediately clockwise of the current cup.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>For example, suppose your cup labeling were <code>389125467</code>. If the crab were to do merely 10 moves, the following changes would occur:</p>\n",
