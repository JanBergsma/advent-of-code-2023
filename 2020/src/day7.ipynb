In fact, it looks like you'll even have time to grab some food: all flights are currently delayed due to <em>issues in luggage processing</em>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Due to recent aviation regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and their contents; bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities of other color-coded bags. Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, consider the following rules:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.\n",
    "dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.\n",
    "bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.\n",
    "muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.\n",

    "vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.\n",
    "faded blue bags contain no other bags.\n",
    "dotted black bags contain no other bags.\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>These rules specify the required contents for 9 bag types. In this example, every <code>faded blue</code> bag is empty, every <code>vibrant plum</code> bag contains 11 bags (5 <code>faded blue</code> and 6 <code>dotted black</code>), and so on.</p>\n",
    "<p>You have a <code><em>shiny gold</em></code> bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag? (In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least one <code>shiny gold</code> bag?)</p>\n",
    "<p>In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>A <code>bright white</code> bag, which can hold your <code>shiny gold</code> bag directly.</li>\n",
    "<li>A <code>muted yellow</code> bag, which can hold your <code>shiny gold</code> bag directly, plus some other bags.</li>\n",
    "<li>A <code>dark orange</code> bag, which can hold <code>bright white</code> and <code>muted yellow</code> bags, either of which could then hold your <code>shiny gold</code> bag.</li>\n",
    "<li>A <code>light red</code> bag, which can hold <code>bright white</code> and <code>muted yellow</code> bags, either of which could then hold your <code>shiny gold</code> bag.</li>\n",
