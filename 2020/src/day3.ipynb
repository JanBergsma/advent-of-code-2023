While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's <span title=\"It looks like the toboggan steering system even runs on Intcode! Good thing you don't have to modify it.\">very minimal steering</span> and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.</p>\n",
