    "<p>So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure out which Aunt Sue (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity) gave you the gift.  You open the present and, as luck would have it, good ol' Aunt Sue got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine!  Just what you wanted.  Or needed, as the case may be.</p>\n",

    "<li><code>goldfish</code>.  No other kinds of fish.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>trees</code>, all in one group.</li>\n",

    "<p>In fact, many of your Aunts Sue have many of these.  You put the wrapping from the gift into the MFCSAM.  It beeps inquisitively at you a few times and then prints out a message on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_tape\">ticker tape</a>:</p>\n",
