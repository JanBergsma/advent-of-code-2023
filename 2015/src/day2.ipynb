They have a list of the dimensions (length <code>l</code>, width <code>w</code>, and height <code>h</code>) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.</p>\n",
    "<p>Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid#Rectangular_cuboid\">right rectangular prism</a>), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is <code>2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l</code>.  The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.</p>\n",
