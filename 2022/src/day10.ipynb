It seems to be some kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube\" target=\"_blank\">cathode-ray tube</a> screen and simple CPU that are both driven by a precise <em>clock circuit</em>. The clock circuit ticks at a constant rate; each tick is called a <em>cycle</em>.</p>\n",

    "<pre><code>noop\n",
    "addx 3\n",
    "addx -5\n",

    "<li>At the start of the second cycle, the <code>addx 3</code> instruction begins execution. During the second cycle, <code>X</code> is still <code>1</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>During the third cycle, <code>X</code> is still <code>1</code>. After the third cycle, the <code>addx 3</code> instruction finishes execution, setting <code>X</code> to <code>4</code>.</li>\n",

Specifically, the sprite is 3 pixels wide, and the <code>X</code> register sets the horizontal position of the <em>middle</em> of that sprite. (In this system, there is no such thing as \"vertical position\": if the sprite's horizontal position puts its pixels where the CRT is currently drawing, then those pixels will be drawn.)</p>\n",
    "<p>You count the pixels on the CRT: 40 wide and 6 high. This CRT screen draws the top row of pixels left-to-right, then the row below that, and so on. The left-most pixel in each row is in position <code>0</code>, and the right-most pixel in each row is in position <code>39</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Like the CPU, the CRT is tied closely to the clock circuit: the CRT draws <em>a single pixel during each cycle</em>. Representing each pixel of the screen as a <code>#</code>, here are the cycles during which the first and last pixel in each row are drawn:</p>\n",
