Actually, hang on - the signal seems like it's coming from the waterfall itself, and that doesn't make any sense. However, you do notice a little path that leads <em>behind</em> the waterfall.</p>\n",
    "<p>Correction: the distress signal leads you behind a giant waterfall! There seems to be a large cave system here, and the signal definitely leads further inside.</p>\n",
    "<p>As you begin to make your way deeper underground, you feel the ground rumble for a moment. Sand begins pouring into the cave! If you don't quickly figure out where the sand is going, you could quickly become trapped!</p>\n",
    "<p>Fortunately, your <a href=\"/2018/day/17\">familiarity</a> with analyzing the path of falling material will come in handy here. You scan a two-dimensional vertical slice of the cave above you (your puzzle input) and discover that it is mostly <em>air</em> with structures made of <em>rock</em>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Your scan traces the path of each solid rock structure and reports the <code>x,y</code> coordinates that form the shape of the path, where <code>x</code> represents distance to the right and <code>y</code> represents distance down. Each path appears as a single line of text in your scan. After the first point of each path, each point indicates the end of a straight horizontal or vertical line to be drawn from the previous point. For example:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>498,4 -&gt; 498,6 -&gt; 496,6\n",
    "503,4 -&gt; 502,4 -&gt; 502,9 -&gt; 494,9\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>This scan means that there are two paths of rock; the first path consists of two straight lines, and the second path consists of three straight lines. (Specifically, the first path consists of a line of rock from <code>498,4</code> through <code>498,6</code> and another line of rock from <code>498,6</code> through <code>496,6</code>.)</p>\n",
    "<p>The sand is pouring into the cave from point <code>500,0</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Drawing rock as <code>#</code>, air as <code>.</code>, and the source of the sand as <code>+</code>, this becomes:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>\n",
    "  4     5  5\n",

    "9 #########.\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Sand is produced <em>one unit at a time</em>, and the next unit of sand is not produced until the previous unit of sand <em>comes to rest</em>. A unit of sand is large enough to fill one tile of air in your scan.</p>\n",
    "<p>A unit of sand always falls <em>down one step</em> if possible. If the tile immediately below is blocked (by rock or sand), the unit of sand attempts to instead move diagonally <em>one step down and to the left</em>. If that tile is blocked, the unit of sand attempts to instead move diagonally <em>one step down and to the right</em>. Sand keeps moving as long as it is able to do so, at each step trying to move down, then down-left, then down-right. If all three possible destinations are blocked, the unit of sand <em>comes to rest</em> and no longer moves, at which point the next unit of sand is created back at the source.</p>\n",
    "<p>So, drawing sand that has come to rest as <code>o</code>, the first unit of sand simply falls straight down and then stops:</p>\n",
