    "<article class=\"day-desc\"><h2>--- Day 1: Calorie Counting ---</h2><p>Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of <a href=\"/2018/day/25\">magical energy</a> to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of <em class=\"star\">star</em> fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.</p>\n",
    "<p>To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of <em class=\"star\">fifty stars</em> by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.</p>\n",
    "<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em class=\"star\">one star</em>. Good luck!</p>\n",
    "<p>The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of <em>Calories</em> each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).</p>\n",
    "<p>The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, <span title=\"By &quot;etc&quot;, you're pretty sure they just mean &quot;more snacks&quot;.\">etc.</span> that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>1000\n",
    "2000\n",
    "3000\n",
    "\n",
    "4000\n",
    "\n",
    "5000\n",
    "6000\n",
    "\n",
    "7000\n",
    "8000\n",
    "9000\n",
    "\n",
    "10000\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>The first Elf is carrying food with <code>1000</code>, <code>2000</code>, and <code>3000</code> Calories, a total of <code><em>6000</em></code> Calories.</li>\n",
    "<li>The second Elf is carrying one food item with <code><em>4000</em></code> Calories.</li>\n",
    "<li>The third Elf is carrying food with <code>5000</code> and <code>6000</code> Calories, a total of <code><em>11000</em></code> Calories.</li>\n",
    "<li>The fourth Elf is carrying food with <code>7000</code>, <code>8000</code>, and <code>9000</code> Calories, a total of <code><em>24000</em></code> Calories.</li>\n",
    "<li>The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with <code><em>10000</em></code> Calories.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the <em>most</em> Calories. In the example above, this is <em><code>24000</code></em> (carried by the fourth Elf).</p>\n",
    "<p>Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. <em>How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?</em></p>\n",
