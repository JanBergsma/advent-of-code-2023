    "<article class=\"day-desc read-aloud\"><h2>--- Day 21: Fractal Art ---</h2><p>You find a program trying to generate some art. It uses a strange process that involves <span title=\"This technique is also often used on TV.\">repeatedly enhancing</span> the detail of an image through a set of rules.</p>\n",
    "<p>The image consists of a two-dimensional square grid of pixels that are either on (<code>#</code>) or off (<code>.</code>). The program always begins with this pattern:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>.#.\n",
    "..#\n",
    "###\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Because the pattern is both <code>3</code> pixels wide and <code>3</code> pixels tall, it is said to have a <em>size</em> of <code>3</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Then, the program repeats the following process:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>If the size is evenly divisible by <code>2</code>, break the pixels up into <code>2x2</code> squares, and convert each <code>2x2</code> square into a <code>3x3</code> square by following the corresponding <em>enhancement rule</em>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Otherwise, the size is evenly divisible by <code>3</code>; break the pixels up into <code>3x3</code> squares, and convert each <code>3x3</code> square into a <code>4x4</code> square by following the corresponding <em>enhancement rule</em>.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>Because each square of pixels is replaced by a larger one, the image gains pixels and so its <em>size</em> increases.</p>\n",
    "<p>The artist's book of enhancement rules is nearby (your puzzle input); however, it seems to be missing rules.  The artist explains that sometimes, one must <em>rotate</em> or <em>flip</em> the input pattern to find a match. (Never rotate or flip the output pattern, though.) Each pattern is written concisely: rows are listed as single units, ordered top-down, and separated by slashes. For example, the following rules correspond to the adjacent patterns:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>../.#  =  ..\n",
    "          .#\n",
    "\n",
    "                .#.\n",
    "\n",
    ".#./..#/### = ..# ###\n",
    "\n",
    "                        #..#\n",
    "\n",
    "#..#/..../#..#/.##. = ....\n",
    "#..#\n",
    ".##.\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>When searching for a rule to use, rotate and flip the pattern as necessary.  For example, all of the following patterns match the same rule:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>.#.   .#.   #..   ###\n",
    "..#   #..   #.#   ..#\n",
    "###   ###   ##.   .#.\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Suppose the book contained the following two rules:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>../.# =&gt; ##./#../...\n",
    ".#./..#/### =&gt; #..#/..../..../#..#\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>As before, the program begins with this pattern:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>.#.\n",
    "..#\n",
    "###\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>The size of the grid (<code>3</code>) is not divisible by <code>2</code>, but it is divisible by <code>3</code>. It divides evenly into a single square; the square matches the second rule, which produces:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>#..#\n",
    "....\n",
    "....\n",
    "#..#\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>The size of this enhanced grid (<code>4</code>) is evenly divisible by <code>2</code>, so that rule is used. It divides evenly into four squares:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>#.|.#\n",
    "..|..\n",
    "--+--\n",
    "..|..\n",
    "#.|.#\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Each of these squares matches the same rule (<code>../.# =&gt; ##./#../...</code>), three of which require some flipping and rotation to line up with the rule. The output for the rule is the same in all four cases:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>##.|##.\n",
    "#..|#..\n",
    "...|...\n",
    "---+---\n",
    "##.|##.\n",
    "#..|#..\n",
    "...|...\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Finally, the squares are joined into a new grid:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>##.##.\n",
    "#..#..\n",
    "......\n",
    "##.##.\n",
    "#..#..\n",
    "......\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Thus, after <code>2</code> iterations, the grid contains <code>12</code> pixels that are <em>on</em>.</p>\n",
    "<p><em>How many pixels stay on</em> after <code>5</code> iterations?</p>\n",
