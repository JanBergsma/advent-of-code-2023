    "<article class=\"day-desc read-aloud\"><h2>--- Day 23: Safe Cracking ---</h2><p>This is one of the top floors of the nicest tower in EBHQ. The Easter Bunny's private office is here, complete with a safe hidden behind a painting, and who <em>wouldn't</em> hide a star in a safe behind a painting?</p>\n",
    "<p>The safe has a digital screen and keypad for code entry. A sticky note attached to the safe has a password hint on it: \"eggs\". The painting is of a large rabbit coloring some eggs. You see <code>7</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>When you go to type the code, though, nothing appears on the display; instead, the keypad comes apart in your hands, apparently having been smashed. Behind it is some kind of socket - one that matches a connector in your <a href=\"11\">prototype computer</a>! You pull apart the smashed keypad and extract the logic circuit, plug it into your computer, and plug your computer into the safe.</p>\n",
    "<p></p>Now, you just need to figure out what output the keypad would have sent to the safe. You extract the <a href=\"12\">assembunny code</a> from the logic chip (your puzzle input).<p></p>\n",
    "<p>The code looks like it uses <em>almost</em> the same architecture and instruction set that the <a href=\"12\">monorail computer</a> used! You should be able to <em>use the same assembunny interpreter</em> for this as you did there, but with one new instruction:</p>\n",
    "<p><code>tgl x</code> <em>toggles</em> the instruction <code>x</code> away (pointing at instructions like <code>jnz</code> does: positive means forward; negative means backward):</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>For <em>one-argument</em> instructions, <code>inc</code> becomes <code>dec</code>, and all other one-argument instructions become <code>inc</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>For <em>two-argument</em> instructions, <code>jnz</code> becomes <code>cpy</code>, and all other two-instructions become <code>jnz</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>The arguments of a toggled instruction are <em>not affected</em>.</li>\n",
    "<li>If an attempt is made to toggle an instruction outside the program, <em>nothing happens</em>.</li>\n",
    "<li>If toggling produces an <em>invalid instruction</em> (like <code>cpy 1 2</code>) and an attempt is later made to execute that instruction, <em>skip it instead</em>.</li>\n",
    "<li>If <code>tgl</code> toggles <em>itself</em> (for example, if <code>a</code> is <code>0</code>, <code>tgl a</code> would target itself and become <code>inc a</code>), the resulting instruction is not executed until the next time it is reached.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>For example, given this program:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>cpy 2 a\n",
    "tgl a\n",
    "tgl a\n",
    "tgl a\n",
    "cpy 1 a\n",
    "dec a\n",
    "dec a\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><code>cpy 2 a</code> initializes register <code>a</code> to <code>2</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>The first <code>tgl a</code> toggles an instruction <code>a</code> (<code>2</code>) away from it, which changes the third <code>tgl a</code> into <code>inc a</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>The second <code>tgl a</code> also modifies an instruction <code>2</code> away from it, which changes the <code>cpy 1 a</code> into <code>jnz 1 a</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>The fourth line, which is now <code>inc a</code>, increments <code>a</code> to <code>3</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Finally, the fifth line, which is now <code>jnz 1 a</code>, jumps <code>a</code> (<code>3</code>) instructions ahead, skipping the <code>dec a</code> instructions.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>In this example, the final value in register <code>a</code> is <code>3</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>The rest of the electronics seem to place the keypad entry (the number of eggs, <code>7</code>) in register <code>a</code>, run the code, and then send the value left in register <code>a</code> to the safe.</p>\n",
    "<p><em>What value</em> should be sent to the safe?</p>\n",
