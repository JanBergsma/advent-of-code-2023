    "<article class=\"day-desc\"><h2>--- Day 2: Bathroom Security ---</h2><p>You arrive at <em>Easter Bunny Headquarters</em> under cover of darkness. However, you left in such a rush that you forgot to use the bathroom! Fancy office buildings like this one usually have keypad locks on their bathrooms, so you search the front desk for the code.</p>\n",
    "<p>\"In order to improve security,\" the document you find says, \"bathroom codes will no longer be written down.  Instead, please memorize and follow the procedure below to access the bathrooms.\"</p>\n",
    "<p>The document goes on to explain that each button to be pressed can be found by starting on the previous button and moving to adjacent buttons on the keypad: <code>U</code> moves up, <code>D</code> moves down, <code>L</code> moves left, and <code>R</code> moves right. Each line of instructions corresponds to one button, starting at the previous button (or, for the first line, <em>the \"5\" button</em>); press whatever button you're on at the end of each line. If a move doesn't lead to a button, ignore it.</p>\n",
    "<p>You can't hold it much longer, so you decide to figure out the code as you walk to the bathroom. You picture a keypad like this:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>1 2 3\n",
    "4 5 6\n",
    "7 8 9\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Suppose your instructions are:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>ULL\n",
    "RRDDD\n",
    "LURDL\n",
    "UUUUD\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>You start at \"5\" and move up (to \"2\"), left (to \"1\"), and left (you can't, and stay on \"1\"), so the first button is <code>1</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Starting from the previous button (\"1\"), you move right twice (to \"3\") and then down three times (stopping at \"9\" after two moves and ignoring the third), ending up with <code>9</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Continuing from \"9\", you move left, up, right, down, and left, ending with <code>8</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Finally, you move up four times (stopping at \"2\"), then down once, ending with <code>5</code>.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>So, in this example, the bathroom code is <code>1985</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Your puzzle input is the instructions from the document you found at the front desk. What is the <em>bathroom code</em>?</p>\n",
