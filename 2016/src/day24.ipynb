    "<p>The robot that cleans the air ducts, however, <em>can</em>.</p>\n",
    "<p>It's not a very fast <span title=\"The Brave Little Air Duct Cleaning Robot That Could\">little robot</span>, but you reconfigure it to be able to interface with some of the exposed wires that have been routed through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC\">HVAC</a> system. If you can direct it to each of those locations, you should be able to bypass the security controls.</p>\n",
    "<p>You extract the duct layout for this area from some blueprints you acquired and create a map with the relevant locations marked (your puzzle input). <code>0</code> is your current location, from which the cleaning robot embarks; the other numbers are (in <em>no particular order</em>) the locations the robot needs to visit at least once each. Walls are marked as <code>#</code>, and open passages are marked as <code>.</code>. Numbers behave like open passages.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, suppose you have a map like the following:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>###########\n",
    "#0.1.....2#\n",
    "#.#######.#\n",
    "#4.......3#\n",
    "###########\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>To reach all of the points of interest as quickly as possible, you would have the robot take the following path:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><code>0</code> to <code>4</code> (<code>2</code> steps)</li>\n",
    "<li><code>4</code> to <code>1</code> (<code>4</code> steps; it can't move diagonally)</li>\n",
    "<li><code>1</code> to <code>2</code> (<code>6</code> steps)</li>\n",
    "<li><code>2</code> to <code>3</code> (<code>2</code> steps)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>Since the robot isn't very fast, you need to find it the <em>shortest route</em>. This path is the fewest steps (in the above example, a total of <code>14</code>) required to start at <code>0</code> and then visit every other location at least once.</p>\n",
    "<p>Given your actual map, and starting from location <code>0</code>, what is the <em>fewest number of steps</em> required to visit every non-<code>0</code> number marked on the map at least once?</p>\n",
