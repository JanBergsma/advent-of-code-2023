    "<article class=\"day-desc\"><h2>--- Day 16: Chronal Classification ---</h2><p>As you see the Elves defend their hot chocolate successfully, you go back to falling through time. This is going to become a problem.</p>\n",
    "<p>If you're ever going to return to your own time, you need to understand how this device on your wrist works. You have a little while before you reach your next destination, and with a bit of trial and error, you manage to pull up a programming manual on the device's tiny screen.</p>\n",
    "<p>According to the manual, the device has four <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_register\">registers</a> (numbered <code>0</code> through <code>3</code>) that can be manipulated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture#Instructions\">instructions</a> containing one of 16 opcodes. The registers start with the value <code>0</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Every instruction consists of four values: an <em>opcode</em>, two <em>inputs</em> (named <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>), and an <em>output</em> (named <code>C</code>), in that order. The opcode specifies the behavior of the instruction and how the inputs are interpreted. The output, <code>C</code>, is always treated as a register.</p>\n",
    "<p>In the opcode descriptions below, if something says \"<em>value <code>A</code></em>\", it means to take the number given as <code>A</code> <em>literally</em>. (This is also called an \"immediate\" value.) If something says \"<em>register <code>A</code></em>\", it means to use the number given as <code>A</code> to read from (or write to) the <em>register with that number</em>. So, if the opcode <code>addi</code> adds register <code>A</code> and value <code>B</code>, storing the result in register <code>C</code>, and the instruction <code>addi 0 7 3</code> is encountered, it would add <code>7</code> to the value contained by register <code>0</code> and store the sum in register <code>3</code>, never modifying registers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code> in the process.</p>\n",
    "<p>Many opcodes are similar except for how they interpret their arguments. The opcodes fall into seven general categories:</p>\n",
    "<p>Addition:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><code>addr</code> (add register) stores into register <code>C</code> the result of adding register <code>A</code> and register <code>B</code>.</li>\n",

    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>Unfortunately, while the manual gives the <em>name</em> of each opcode, it doesn't seem to indicate the <em>number</em>. However, you can monitor the CPU to see the contents of the registers before and after instructions are executed to try to work them out.  Each opcode has a number from <code>0</code> through <code>15</code>, but the manual doesn't say which is which. For example, suppose you capture the following sample:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>Before: [3, 2, 1, 1]\n",
    "9 2 1 2\n",
    "After:  [3, 2, 2, 1]\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>This sample shows the effect of the instruction <code>9 2 1 2</code> on the registers. Before the instruction is executed, register <code>0</code> has value <code>3</code>, register <code>1</code> has value <code>2</code>, and registers <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> have value <code>1</code>. After the instruction is executed, register <code>2</code>'s value becomes <code>2</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>The instruction itself, <code>9 2 1 2</code>, means that opcode <code>9</code> was executed with <code>A=2</code>, <code>B=1</code>, and <code>C=2</code>. Opcode <code>9</code> could be any of the 16 opcodes listed above, but only three of them behave in a way that would cause the result shown in the sample:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Opcode <code>9</code> could be <code>mulr</code>: register <code>2</code> (which has a value of <code>1</code>) times register <code>1</code> (which has a value of <code>2</code>) produces <code>2</code>, which matches the value stored in the output register, register <code>2</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Opcode <code>9</code> could be <code>addi</code>: register <code>2</code> (which has a value of <code>1</code>) plus value <code>1</code> produces <code>2</code>, which matches the value stored in the output register, register <code>2</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Opcode <code>9</code> could be <code>seti</code>: value <code>2</code> matches the value stored in the output register, register <code>2</code>; the number given for <code>B</code> is irrelevant.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>None of the other opcodes produce the result captured in the sample. Because of this, the sample above <em>behaves like three opcodes</em>.</p>\n",
    "<p>You collect many of these samples (the first section of your puzzle input). The manual also includes a small test program (the second section of your puzzle input) - you can <em>ignore it for now</em>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Ignoring the opcode numbers, <em>how many samples in your puzzle input behave like three or more opcodes?</em></p>\n",
