Looks like they're here for a fight.</p>\n",
    "<p>You scan the area, generating a map of the walls (<code>#</code>), open cavern (<code>.</code>), and starting position of every Goblin (<code>G</code>) and Elf (<code>E</code>) (your puzzle input).</p>\n",
    "<p>Combat proceeds in <em>rounds</em>; in each round, each unit that is still alive takes a <em>turn</em>, resolving all of its actions before the next unit's turn begins. On each unit's turn, it tries to <em>move</em> into range of an enemy (if it isn't already) and then <em>attack</em> (if it is in range).</p>\n",
    "<p>All units are very disciplined and always follow very strict combat rules. Units never move or attack diagonally, as doing so would be dishonorable. When multiple choices are equally valid, ties are broken in <em>reading order</em>: top-to-bottom, then left-to-right.  For instance, the order in which units take their turns within a round is the <em>reading order of their starting positions</em> in that round, regardless of the type of unit or whether other units have moved after the round started.  For example:</p>\n",

    "<p>Each unit begins its turn by identifying all possible <em>targets</em> (enemy units). If no targets remain, combat ends.</p>\n",
    "<p>Then, the unit identifies all of the open squares (<code>.</code>) that are <em>in range</em> of each target; these are the squares which are <em>adjacent</em> (immediately up, down, left, or right) to any target and which aren't already occupied by a wall or another unit. Alternatively, the unit might <em>already</em> be in range of a target. If the unit is not already in range of a target, and there are no open squares which are in range of a target, the unit ends its turn.</p>\n",
    "<p>If the unit is already in range of a target, it does not <em>move</em>, but continues its turn with an <em>attack</em>. Otherwise, since it is not in range of a target, it <em>moves</em>.</p>\n",
    "<p>To <em>move</em>, the unit first considers the squares that are <em>in range</em> and determines <em>which of those squares it could reach in the fewest steps</em>. A <em>step</em> is a single movement to any <em>adjacent</em> (immediately up, down, left, or right) open (<code>.</code>) square. Units cannot move into walls or other units. The unit does this while considering the <em>current positions of units</em> and does <em>not</em> do any prediction about where units will be later. If the unit cannot reach (find an open path to) any of the squares that are in range, it ends its turn. If multiple squares are in range and <em>tied</em> for being reachable in the fewest steps, the square which is first in <em>reading order</em> is chosen. For example:</p>\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Each of the Goblins has open, adjacent squares which are <em>in range</em> (marked with a <code>?</code> on the map).</li>\n",
