    "<p>The Elves would like to build a new monitoring station in a nearby area of space; they hand you a map of all of the asteroids in that region (your puzzle input).</p>\n",
    "<p>The map indicates whether each position is empty (<code>.</code>) or contains an asteroid (<code>#</code>).  The asteroids are much smaller than they appear on the map, and every asteroid is exactly in the center of its marked position.  The asteroids can be described with <code>X,Y</code> coordinates where <code>X</code> is the distance from the left edge and <code>Y</code> is the distance from the top edge (so the top-left corner is <code>0,0</code> and the position immediately to its right is <code>1,0</code>).</p>\n",
    "<p>Your job is to figure out which asteroid would be the best place to build a <em>new monitoring station</em>. A monitoring station can <em>detect</em> any asteroid to which it has <em>direct line of sight</em> - that is, there cannot be another asteroid <em>exactly</em> between them. This line of sight can be at any angle, not just lines aligned to the grid or <span title=\"The Elves on Ceres are clearly not concerned with honor.\">diagonally</span>. The <em>best</em> location is the asteroid that can <em>detect</em> the largest number of other asteroids.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, consider the following map:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>.#..#\n",
    ".....\n",

    "....#\n",
    "...<em>#</em>#\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>The best location for a new monitoring station on this map is the highlighted asteroid at <code>3,4</code> because it can detect <code>8</code> asteroids, more than any other location. (The only asteroid it cannot detect is the one at <code>1,0</code>; its view of this asteroid is blocked by the asteroid at <code>2,2</code>.) All other asteroids are worse locations; they can detect <code>7</code> or fewer other asteroids. Here is the number of other asteroids a monitoring station on each asteroid could detect:</p>\n",

    ".....\n",
    "67775\n",
    "....7\n",
    "...87\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Here is an asteroid (<code>#</code>) and some examples of the ways its line of sight might be blocked. If there were another asteroid at the location of a capital letter, the locations marked with the corresponding lowercase letter would be blocked and could not be detected:</p>\n",

    "<article class=\"day-desc\"><h2 id=\"part2\">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Once you give them the coordinates, the Elves quickly deploy an Instant Monitoring Station to the location and discover <span title=\"The Elves on Ceres just have a unique system of values, that's all.\">the worst</span>: there are simply too many asteroids.</p>\n",
    "<p>The only solution is <em>complete vaporization by giant laser</em>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Fortunately, in addition to an asteroid scanner, the new monitoring station also comes equipped with a giant rotating laser perfect for vaporizing asteroids. The laser starts by pointing <em>up</em> and always rotates <em>clockwise</em>, vaporizing any asteroid it hits.</p>\n",
    "<p>If multiple asteroids are <em>exactly</em> in line with the station, the laser only has enough power to vaporize <em>one</em> of them before continuing its rotation. In other words, the same asteroids that can be <em>detected</em> can be vaporized, but if vaporizing one asteroid makes another one detectable, the newly-detected asteroid won't be vaporized until the laser has returned to the same position by rotating a full 360 degrees.</p>\n",
