However, to catch up with the large backlog of parts requests, the factory will also need a <em>large supply of lava</em> for a while; the Elves have already started creating a large lagoon nearby for this purpose.</p>\n",
    "<p>However, they aren't sure the lagoon will be big enough; they've asked you to take a look at the <em>dig plan</em> (your puzzle input). For example:</p>\n",

    "<p>The digger starts in a 1 meter cube hole in the ground. They then dig the specified number of meters <em>up</em> (<code>U</code>), <em>down</em> (<code>D</code>), <em>left</em> (<code>L</code>), or <em>right</em> (<code>R</code>), clearing full 1 meter cubes as they go. The directions are given as seen from above, so if \"up\" were north, then \"right\" would be east, and so on.
