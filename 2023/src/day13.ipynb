        "<p>There's just one problem: you don't see any <em>lava</em>.</p>\n",
        "<p>You <em>do</em> see a lot of ash and igneous rock; there are even what look like gray mountains scattered around. After a while, you make your way to a nearby cluster of mountains only to discover that the valley between them is completely full of large <em>mirrors</em>.  Most of the mirrors seem to be aligned in a consistent way; perhaps you should head in that direction?</p>\n",
        "<p>As you move through the valley of mirrors, you find that several of them have fallen from the large metal frames keeping them in place. The mirrors are extremely flat and shiny, and many of the fallen mirrors have lodged into the ash at strange angles. Because the terrain is all one color, it's hard to tell where it's safe to walk or where you're about to run into a mirror.</p>\n",
        "<p>You note down the patterns of ash (<code>.</code>) and rocks (<code>#</code>) that you see as you walk (your puzzle input); perhaps by carefully analyzing these patterns, you can figure out where the mirrors are!</p>\n",

Because the vertical line is not perfectly in the middle of the pattern, part of the pattern (column 1) has nowhere to reflect onto and can be ignored; every other column has a reflected column within the pattern and must match exactly: column 2 matches column 9, column 3 matches 8, 4 matches 7, and 5 matches 6.</p>\n",

        "<p>To <em>summarize</em> your pattern notes, add up <em>the number of columns</em> to the left of each vertical line of reflection; to that, also add <em>100 multiplied by the number of rows</em> above each horizontal line of reflection.
